- 👋 Hi, I’m @patlaff
- 🏢 I work in professional services as a Azure Cloud Solutions Architect. I specialize in Cloud Foundations, DevOps, CI/CD, and IaC. I also have a background in Data & Analytics, specifically with standing up and optimizing MPP Data Warehouses such as Azure Synapse, and Data Lake technologies such as Databricks and Snowflake.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes, and I'm dabbling with getting lightweight K8s distributions configured on self-hosted bare-metal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything, but I spend a lot of time self-hosting services and game servers for friends and family and love contributing to container-based projects to help others do the same in an easy, configuration-based way.
- 📫 How to reach me - feel free to submit issues/PR's on any of my public repo's.
